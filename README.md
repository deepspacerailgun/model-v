# model-v

https://trashman.wiki/en/community/pcbs/model-v

used matthewdias' open-source model-v and made some changes including removing the flex cuts and changing the bottom row to support minisub layout options

also removed the silkscreen because it's not really model-v anymore

have not ordered any so it's on you to check to make sure it works before you place an order
